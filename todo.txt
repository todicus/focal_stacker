To do:

- add sliders to GUI for time range to process (won't be necc if I have a batch engine)
- warn if warp file cannot be created due to insufficient fits (how to know?
  - implemented checking if warp file actually exists after creation (though this fails to generate a warning if the warp file name already existed)
  - can equalize with ImageStack if neccessary (maybe just tell user that))
- with single, set output to same folder?
- call each single stack as a separate thread from the GUI controller, to keep track of progress, allow cancel, preview, etc
